            <p>ur not a failure or a <a href="/assets/img/disapp.png" target="_blank">disappointment</a> or anything of the sort. seriously! as someone who greatly cares about u, it saddens me seeing u say shit like that cuz it's not true. at cadets and thru generally interacting with u, i can tell ur working rlly hard whilst dealing with a lot of challenging circumstances outside of ur control and tbh what else can u do.</p>
            <p>ur doing great; im not lying to ur face cuz i think thats what u wanna hear, i genuinely think ur doing great. whilst important, grades arent a hollistic reflection of who u are, and ik its easy to say that when i have good grades but i mean that genuinely. no percentage is ever truly representative of a person's passions or competences and ur no exception to that. fwiw im proud of u.</p>
            <p>i really hope u found this page because this is the shit i wanna tell u on the regular despite knowing that u dont believe me. i dont know how to be more blunt or communicative than this. maybe this is lwk just not how u want to hear this sort of thing but its how i learned to communicate, idk!</p>
            <!--also lwk its kind of annoying that ull sometimes bring shit up then refuse to acknowledge it (ie: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1064735054607155281/1174511500652724264) but honestly it's just a matter of communication. i did that a lot as well (before realising it's annoying).-->
